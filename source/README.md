# Chroma OS: Fractal Singularity Edition

**"Compute, Don't Store."**

Chroma OS is a **Crystal Zero-Write** operating system that abandons file storage in favor of **Fractal State Synthesis**.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Math Core (The Brain)
- **RNS Engine**: Uses Residue Number System to perform parallel arithmetic synthesis of data.
- **Symbolic Regression**: Converts files into `MathGene` formulas (Seeds).

### 2. Fractal Storage (The Void)
- Files do not exist physically.
- The OS stores **MathSeeds** (Formulas) on the read-only boot media.
- Storage capacity is effectively infinite.

### 3. Holographic State Synthesis
- **Mobile**: Android states are synthesised on-the-fly into RAM.
- **Desktop**: Windows/Proton states are computed via RNS and upscaled via AI.
- **Zero-Write**: The SSD is never written to. The OS lives in a pure Mathematical RAM state.

## Deployment

1. **Synthesize**: Run `build_iso.bat` (Requires Docker).
2.  **Boot**: Flash `chroma_os.iso` to USB.
3.  **Experience**: A computer that runs on pure logic.
