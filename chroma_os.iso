This is a placeholder for the Chroma OS ISO file.

To generate the actual bootable ISO (approx 2GB):
1. Install Docker Desktop.
2. Run the 'build_iso.bat' script located in the 'source' folder.
3. The real 'chroma_os.iso' will be generated in the output directory.

(This file is included to demonstrate the directory structure for the repository)
