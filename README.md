**Experience the future of operating systems, running entirely in your browser.**

This repository contains the **Chroma OS Simulator**, a high-fidelity web-based demonstration of the "Fractal Singularity" architecture. It mimics the behavior of the crystal-zero write operating system, featuring a full window manager, simulated cross-platform state synthesis, and a unified settings environment.

*   **Universal Holographic Bridge**: Simulates running **Windows**, **Android**, and **iOS** applications simultaneously via state synthesis.
*   **Desktop Experience**:
    *   **Window Manager**: Mutli-tasking with draggable, resizable, and focus-aware windows (macOS style focus).
    *   **Start Menu**: Windows 11-style menu with pinned apps and search.
    *   **Taskbar & Tray**: Functional taskbar with running app indicators, Wi-Fi status, and clock.
*   **System Apps**:
    *   **Chroma Surf**: A functional web browser simulator.
    *   **Chroma Terminal**: Interactive command-line interface (`dir`, `ver`, `synth`).
    *   **Settings**: A massive styling unification of Windows, Mac, and Android settings into one neutral "Chroma" suite.
*   **Power Management**: Functional simulation of Sleep, Restart, and Shutdown states.
